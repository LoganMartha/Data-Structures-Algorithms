# Data Strcutures & Algorithms

The goal of this project was to test my ability to understand specific data and to choose a proper data structure that would meet the requirments of the project at hand in the most efficient and effective way.  The purpose of this program is to take in data from another file and to be able to manipulate that data.  Given the requirments, I was to use the best data strcuture, in this case it was a BST.  From there I would create the code that allowed for the proper manipulation of the data.
