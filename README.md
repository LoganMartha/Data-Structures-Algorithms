# Cplusplus-Program-2

The goal of this project was to help familiarize myself with how to determine proper data structures to utilize given the requirements of the program.  It also allowed me to improve my skills in implementing algorithms to manipulate the data.  During this project, I felt that I did a great job in regards to my debudding process.  In previous projects, I would look to try to write all the source code and try to debug the entirety of it at once.  In order to reduce the debugging time, I broke the project up into sections and tested as I went.  This made it far less time consuming and made it easy to pick up on those little syntax mistakes that may take a long time to find in the entirety of the code.  In order to enhance my code, I could have implmented additional functions towards the "loadCourses" function.  Since there were various bits of data, there were different methods needed to make their the data was properly assigned.  I could have broken that up into multiple functions to enhance readbility and modification in the future.  Since a lot of the course work I did during this term set me up for success in this final project, there was not a point of feeling lost or imposing a challenge that I could not over come.  This course and project has introduced me to data strucutres and algorithms that I will be able to apply in my future studies and projects.  It also has helped improve my probelm solving skills as a developer, that will always be applied in my future endeavors.
