# Data Strcutures & Algorithms

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to analyze specific data requirements and select an appropriate data structure that efficiently meets those needs. The program takes input data from a file and allows for its manipulation according to the requirements specified. Based on the criteria, a Binary Search Tree (BST) was chosen as the most suitable data structure for this task. The implementation focuses on creating code that efficiently manages and manipulates the data using the BST.
